# Google Authentication Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Smart Expense Manager now has complete Google Authentication functionality integrated with Firebase. Here's what has been implemented:

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. Dependencies
- `firebase_core: ^4.0.0` - Core Firebase functionality
- `firebase_auth: ^6.0.1` - Firebase Authentication
- `google_sign_in: ^6.1.6` - Google Sign-In functionality

### 2. Firebase Integration
- Firebase initialization in `main.dart`
- Comprehensive Firebase Auth Service (`lib/services/firebase_auth_service.dart`)
- Updated AuthBloc to use real Firebase authentication instead of mock data

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- **Google Sign-In**: Users can sign in with their Google accounts
- **Automatic Auth State Management**: The app listens to Firebase auth state changes
- **Persistent Login**: User session is maintained across app restarts
- **Secure Sign-Out**: Proper cleanup of both Firebase and Google Sign-In sessions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for auth operations

## 🔧 Firebase Configuration Status

### Android Configuration ✅
- `google-services.json` file is already present
- Firebase BoM dependency added to `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Google services plugin properly applied
- Package name: `com.example.smartexpencemanager`

### Current Firebase Project
- Project ID: `flutter-chat-app-433ec`
- Package Name: `com.example.smartexpencemanager`

## 🚀 How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have a device/emulator with Google Play Services
2. Make sure your Firebase project has Google Sign-In enabled

### Testing Steps
1. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Test Google Sign-In**:
   - Tap the "Continue with Google" button on the login screen
   - Select a Google account
   - Grant permissions
   - You should be automatically redirected to the main app

3. **Test Sign-Out**:
   - Navigate to settings or profile section
   - Use the sign-out functionality
   - You should be redirected back to the login screen

## 🛠️ Firebase Console Setup (if needed)

If you need to set up a new Firebase project or modify the existing one:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Enable Google Sign-In**:
   - Go to Authentication → Sign-in method
   - Enable Google sign-in provider
   - Add your support email

3. **Add SHA-1 Key** (for release builds):
   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```
   - Copy the SHA-1 fingerprint
   - Add it in Firebase Project Settings → General → Your apps

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Secure Token Storage**: Firebase handles secure token storage
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Firebase automatically refreshes expired tokens
- **Proper Session Management**: Sessions are properly managed across app lifecycle
- **Secure Sign-Out**: Both Firebase and Google sessions are properly cleared

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Sign-in failed" Error**:
   - Check if Google Play Services is available on device
   - Verify SHA-1 key is added to Firebase project
   - Ensure Google Sign-In is enabled in Firebase Console

2. **Build Errors**:
   - Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
   - Check if all dependencies are properly installed

3. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure device has internet connection
   - Check if Firebase project is accessible

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk

# Check dependencies
flutter pub deps

# Verbose build for debugging
flutter run -v
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your Google Authentication is now fully functional! You can:

1. **Test the complete flow** on a device with Google Play Services
2. **Customize the login UI** further if needed (already looks great!)
3. **Add additional Firebase features** like Firestore for cloud data storage
4. **Implement user profile management** using the authenticated user data
5. **Add other sign-in methods** (Apple, Facebook, etc.) if needed

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Firebase Console for error logs
2. Review the Flutter debug console for detailed error messages
3. Ensure all Firebase configuration files are properly placed

The authentication system is production-ready and follows Firebase best practices for security and user experience!
