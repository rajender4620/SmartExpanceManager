1️⃣ JavaScript Basics
🔹 Variables (var, let, const)
js
CopyEdit
var x = 10;  // Function-scoped (avoid using)
let y = 20;  // Block-scoped (preferred)
const z = 30; // Cannot be reassigned

🔹 Data Types
Primitive: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
Reference: object, array, function

let str = "Hello"; // String
let num = 42; // Number
let bool = true; // Boolean
let arr = [1, 2, 3]; // Array
let obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 }; // Object

2️⃣ Functions in JavaScript
🔹 Regular Function
js
CopyEdit
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(3, 5)); // 8
🔹 Arrow Function (ES6+)
js
CopyEdit
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // 20
🔹 Function as a Variable
js
CopyEdit
const greet = function(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice!
3️⃣ JavaScript Scope & Hoisting
🔹 Function Scope vs Block Scope
js
CopyEdit
if (true) {
  var a = 10;  // Accessible outside the block (BAD)
  let b = 20;  // Only accessible inside the block (GOOD)
}
console.log(a); // ✅ 10
console.log(b); // ❌ Error
🔹 Hoisting (Moves declarations to the top)
js
CopyEdit
console.log(x); // ✅ undefined (Hoisted)
var x = 10;
js
CopyEdit
console.log(y); // ❌ ReferenceError (let & const are NOT hoisted)
let y = 20;
4️⃣ JavaScript Asynchronous Concepts
🔹 Callbacks (Old way)
js
CopyEdit
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data received");
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData((message) => console.log(message)); // "Data received" after 1 sec
🔹 Promises (ES6)
js
CopyEdit
const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Data received");
  }, 1000);
});

fetchData.then((message) => console.log(message)); // "Data received"
🔹 Async/Await (Best way)
js
CopyEdit
async function fetchData() {
  return "Data received";
}

fetchData().then(console.log); // "Data received"
5️⃣ ES6+ Features You Must Know
🔹 Destructuring
js
CopyEdit
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name, age); // Alice 25
🔹 Spread Operator ...
js
CopyEdit
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];
console.log(arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

🚀 JavaScript Hoisting - Detailed Notes
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved (hoisted) to the top of their scope during the memory creation phase before execution.
1️⃣ What is Hoisting?
Before JavaScript executes the code, it scans for variable and function declarations and moves them to the top of their scope.
Hoisting only moves declarations, NOT initializations.
This means you can use functions before declaring them, but variables declared with var will be undefined until they are initialized.
2️⃣ Hoisting with var
Variables declared with var are hoisted but initialized with undefined.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
console.log(a); // ❓ What will this print?
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // ✅ Prints 10
🔍 How JavaScript Interprets This:
javascript
CopyEdit
var a; // ✅ Declaration is hoisted
console.log(a); // ❌ `undefined` (a exists but is not initialized)
a = 10; // ✅ Now `a` is initialized
console.log(a); // ✅ Prints 10
Key Takeaways:
✔ var is hoisted and gets undefined as an initial value.
 ✔ Accessing var before initialization does NOT throw an error.
3️⃣ Hoisting with let and const (TDZ - Temporal Dead Zone)
Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted, but they are NOT initialized.
They stay in a "Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)" from the start of the block until initialization.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 5;
console.log(x);
🔍 How JavaScript Interprets This:
javascript
CopyEdit
// Declaration is hoisted, but NOT initialized (TDZ)
let x;
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError (x is in TDZ)
x = 5; // ✅ Now x is initialized
console.log(x); // ✅ Prints 5
Key Takeaways:
✔ let and const are hoisted but stay in the TDZ until initialized.
 ✔ Accessing let or const before declaration throws a ReferenceError.
4️⃣ Hoisting with Function Declarations
Function declarations are fully hoisted (both declaration and function body).
This means you can call a function before it is defined.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
sayHello(); // ✅ Works even before definition

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
How JavaScript Interprets This:
javascript
CopyEdit
// Function is hoisted completely
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

sayHello(); // ✅ Prints "Hello!"
Key Takeaways:
✔ Function declarations are hoisted completely, meaning they can be called before they appear in the code.
 ✔ This does NOT happen with function expressions (see next section).
5️⃣ Hoisting with Function Expressions (🚨 Not Fully Hoisted)
Function expressions (when a function is assigned to a variable) do NOT get hoisted like function declarations.
The variable is hoisted, but it remains undefined until assigned.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
greet(); // ❌ Error: greet is not a function

var greet = function() {
    console.log("Hi!");
};

greet(); // ✅ Works fine
🔍 How JavaScript Interprets This:
javascript
CopyEdit
var greet; // ✅ Variable is hoisted, but it is `undefined`

greet(); // ❌ `TypeError: greet is not a function` (because it is `undefined`)

greet = function() {
    console.log("Hi!");
};

greet(); // ✅ Works now
Key Takeaways:
✔ Only the variable is hoisted, NOT the function itself.
 ✔ If you call a function expression before assignment, you get an error.
 ✔ Use function declarations if you need hoisting.
6️⃣ Summary Table

7️⃣ Hoisting Best Practices
✅ Use let and const instead of var to avoid unexpected undefined.
 ✅ Use function declarations instead of function expressions if you need hoisting.
 ✅ Avoid accessing variables before they are declared to prevent TDZ errors.

🔥 JavaScript Scope: The Foundation of Variable Accessibility
Scope determines where variables are accessible in your code. Understanding scope helps you write cleaner, bug-free code and avoid unexpected behavior.
1️⃣ What is Scope?
Scope defines where a variable is accessible within a program.
 In JavaScript, we have three main types of scope:
Global Scope – Accessible anywhere in the code.
Function Scope – Only accessible inside a function.
Block Scope (ES6) – Accessible inside {} (for let & const).
2️⃣ Global Scope (🌍 Accessible Everywhere)
Any variable declared outside of a function is in the global scope.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
let globalVar = "I am global!";

function test() {
    console.log(globalVar); // ✅ Accessible
}

test();
console.log(globalVar); // ✅ Accessible
Output:
csharp
CopyEdit
I am global!
I am global!
✔ globalVar is accessible inside the function because it's in the global scope.
3️⃣ Function Scope (🔒 Accessible Only Inside the Function)
Variables declared with var, let, or const inside a function are function-scoped.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
function myFunction() {
    let funcVar = "Inside Function";
    console.log(funcVar); // ✅ Accessible inside the function
}

myFunction();
console.log(funcVar); // ❌ ReferenceError: funcVar is not defined
✔ funcVar is only available insidemyFunction().
4️⃣ Block Scope (🧱 Introduced in ES6 with let and const)
let and const are block-scoped, meaning they only exist inside {} blocks.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "Inside Block";
    console.log(blockVar); // ✅ Accessible inside the block
}

console.log(blockVar); // ❌ ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
✔ blockVaronly exists inside the if block.
5️⃣ var vs let vs const in Scope
Feature

❌ No
✅ Yes
✅ Yes
Hoisted
✅ Yes (but initialized as undefined)
✅ Yes (but in TDZ)
✅ Yes (but in TDZ)
Reassignable
✅ Yes
✅ Yes
❌ No
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
if (true) {
    var x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    const z = 30;
}

console.log(x); // ✅ 10 (var is NOT block-scoped)
console.log(y); // ❌ ReferenceError: y is not defined
console.log(z); // ❌ ReferenceError: z is not defined
✔ x is accessible because var is not block-scoped.
 ❌ y and z are inaccessible outside the block.
6️⃣ Nested Scope (Scope Chain 🔗)
If a variable is not found in the current scope, JavaScript looks up the outer scopes.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
let outerVar = "I'm outside!";

function outer() {
    let innerVar = "I'm inside!";
    
    function inner() {
        console.log(outerVar); // ✅ Found in outer scope
        console.log(innerVar); // ✅ Found in function scope
    }

    inner();
}

outer();
Output:
rust
CopyEdit
I'm outside!
I'm inside!
✔ outerVar is found in the outer scope.
 ✔ innerVar is found in function scope.
🔥 Key Takeaways (Important for Interviews & Debugging)
✔ Global scope variables can be accessed anywhere.
 ✔ Function scope variables are only accessible inside the function.
 ✔ Block scope variables (let & const) exist only inside {}.
 ✔ var is function-scoped, NOT block-scoped.
 ✔ JavaScript uses a Scope Chain to find variables in outer scopes.

🔥 JavaScript Closures: The Power of Remembering Variables
Closures are one of the most important and powerful concepts in JavaScript. They allow functions to "remember" variables from their outer scope, even after execution.
1️⃣ What is a Closure?
A closure is a function that remembers the variables from its outer function scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
function outer() {
    let count = 0; // This variable is inside outer()
    
    function inner() {
        count++; // inner() remembers count
        console.log(count);
    }
    
    return inner; // Return the inner function
}

const myFunc = outer(); // outer() executes and returns inner()

myFunc(); // 🔥 Output: 1
myFunc(); // 🔥 Output: 2
myFunc(); // 🔥 Output: 3
✔ Even though outer() has finished execution, inner()remembers the count variable!
 ✔ Every time we call myFunc(), it still has access to count.
2️⃣ How Closures Work? (Step-by-Step Execution)
outer() is called, creating count = 0.
outer()returns inner function, but count is still remembered.
Every time myFunc() is called, inner() modifies and logs count.
count persists across function calls because of the closure.
3️⃣ Why Use Closures?
✅ Data Privacy (Encapsulation) – Prevent variables from being accessed directly.
 ✅ Maintaining State – Store values across multiple function calls.
 ✅ Avoid Global Variables – Prevent polluting the global scope.
4️⃣ Real-World Examples of Closures
📌 Example 1: Private Variables (Data Encapsulation)
Closures allow us to create private variables that can only be accessed through methods.
javascript
CopyEdit
function counter() {
    let count = 0;

    return {
        increment: function() {
            count++;
            console.log(count);
        },
        decrement: function() {
            count--;
            console.log(count);
        }
    };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter.increment(); // 🔥 Output: 1
myCounter.increment(); // 🔥 Output: 2
myCounter.decrement(); // 🔥 Output: 1
✔ count is private and cannot be accessed directly from outside.
📌 Example 2: Function Factory
Closures can be used to create multiple functions with different "remembered" values.
javascript
CopyEdit
function multiplier(factor) {
    return function (num) {
        return num * factor;
    };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
const triple = multiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 🔥 Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 🔥 Output: 15
✔ double remembers factor = 2, and triple remembers factor = 3.
📌 Example 3: Delayed Execution (setTimeout)
Closures help preserve variables inside setTimeout() loops.
javascript
CopyEdit
function delayedGreeting(name) {
    return function () {
        console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    };
}

const greetJohn = delayedGreeting("John");
setTimeout(greetJohn, 2000); // 🔥 Prints "Hello, John!" after 2 seconds
✔ The function remembers name even after delayedGreeting() finishes execution.
5️⃣ Common Mistakes with Closures
🚨 Mistake 1: Unexpected Behavior in Loops
javascript
CopyEdit
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(i); // ❌ Always prints 4, not 1, 2, 3!
    }, 1000);
}
✔ Fix: Use let instead of var (block-scoped).
javascript
CopyEdit
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(i); // ✅ Prints 1, 2, 3
    }, 1000);
}
🔥 Key Takeaways
✔ Closures allow functions to remember variables from their outer scope.
 ✔ They are created whenever a function is returned from another function.
 ✔ Useful for data privacy, maintaining state, and function factories.
 ✔ Help with async behavior like setTimeout().

🔥 What Is a Closure?
A closure happens when:
 1️⃣ A function (inner function) is inside another function (outer function).
 2️⃣ The inner function remembers the variables from the outer function even after the outer function has finished executing.
✅ Step 1: Understanding the Basic Example
javascript
CopyEdit
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I am from outer!"; // This variable is inside outerFunction

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Can innerFunction access outerVariable?
    }

    return innerFunction; // Returning innerFunction (but NOT calling it yet!)
}

const myClosure = outerFunction(); // 🔥 outerFunction runs & returns innerFunction
myClosure(); // 🔥 Output: "I am from outer!"
📌 What is happening here?
1️⃣ outerFunction() runs → outerVariable is created.
 2️⃣ innerFunction() is returned but not called yet.
 3️⃣ Even though outerFunction() is finished, innerFunction()remembersouterVariable!
 4️⃣ When we call myClosure(), it still has access to outerVariable.
✅ Step 2: Why Is This Useful?
Closures allow data to stay private and remember values without using global variables.
📌 Example: Creating a Counter Without Global Variables
javascript
CopyEdit
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable (not global)

    return function() {
        count++; // ✅ This function remembers `count`
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const counter1 = createCounter(); // Creates a new counter
counter1(); // 🔥 Output: 1
counter1(); // 🔥 Output: 2

const counter2 = createCounter(); // Creates a separate counter
counter2(); // 🔥 Output: 1 (different count)
📌 Why use a closure here?
✔ count is not global (private to createCounter()).
 ✔ Each createCounter() call gets its own separate counter.
✅ Step 3: Thinking About Closures Simply
Think of a closure as a backpack 🎒 that an inner function carries.
The inner function takes variables from the outer function and keeps them in its backpack.
Even if the outer function is gone, the inner function still has its backpack and remembers the variables.
✅ Step 4: Real-World Example (Click Event)
Closures are everywhere in JavaScript, especially in event listeners.
javascript
CopyEdit
function buttonClickHandler() {
    let clicks = 0; // Private variable (closure)

    return function() {
        clicks++;
        console.log(`Button clicked ${clicks} times`);
    };
}

const handleClick = buttonClickHandler(); // Closure is created

document.getElementById("clickMe").addEventListener("click", handleClick);
✔ Why use closures here?
The event listener remembersclicks even after buttonClickHandler() finishes.
No need for a global variable to track clicks.
🔥 Final Summary
✔ A function inside another function = Closure.
 ✔ Closures remember variables from their outer function even after it has finished.
 ✔ Used for data privacy, counters, event listeners, and asynchronous code.
